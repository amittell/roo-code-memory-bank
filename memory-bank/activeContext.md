# User Guide Analysis and Improvement Plan
 
## Analysis of `user-guide.txt`

Based on a critical review of `roo-code-memory-bank/docs/user-guide.md` from the perspective of a new Roo Code user, the following areas for improvement have been identified:

**1. "Before You Begin" Section:**

*   **Issue:** Could be more welcoming and emphasize the benefit of the Memory Bank more strongly upfront.
*   **Suggestion:** Reword to be more encouraging and highlight the core problem the Memory Bank solves for new users (memory resets).  Example: "Welcome to Roo Code Memory Bank! Tired of AI assistants forgetting your project details? The Memory Bank is your solution..."

**2. "Getting Started" - Prerequisites:**

*   **Issue:** "Basic understanding of Markdown syntax" might be a slight barrier for truly novice users.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a very brief explanation of Markdown or rephrase to "Familiarity with basic text formatting".

**3. "Getting Started" - First-Time Setup Checklist - Step 3: "Configure custom instructions via Roo Code settings."**

*   **Issue:** Vague and not explicit enough about *where* and *what* to paste.
*   **Suggestion:** Make this step much more detailed and explicit with step-by-step instructions, specifying settings location and files to copy content from.

**4. "Getting Started" - First-Time Setup Checklist - Step 5: "Experience 'Wakeup' Functionality"**

*   **Issue:** "Wakeup Functionality" is developer-centric.
*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to "Initial Workspace Scan and Project Selection" or "Automatic Project Detection".

**5. "Getting Started" - First-Time Setup Checklist - Step 9: "Create Memory Bank Files in Code Mode (Following Roo's Plan)"**

*   **Issue:** Relies on user understanding of Roo's plan provision.
*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to be more reassuring and explicit about Roo providing a plan in chat.

**6. "Getting Started" - Workflow Diagram:**

*   **Issue:** ASCII diagram is not user-friendly.
*   **Suggestion:** Replace with a proper visual flowchart image (to be added manually later).

**7. "Handling Multiple Projects in a Workspace" Section:**

*   **Issue:** Inconsistent formatting in example prompt code block.
*   **Suggestion:** Clean up formatting for visual consistency.

**8. "Understanding Memory Bank Files" Section - Introduction:**

*   **Issue:** Slightly inaccurate description of Memory Bank file creation.
*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to accurately reflect the Architect/Code mode initialization process.

**9. "Advanced Usage Examples" - Overall:**

*   **Issue:** Examples are lengthy and potentially overwhelming for new users.
*   **Suggestion:** Consider making examples more concise or moving detailed examples to a separate section/document.

**10. "Troubleshooting" Section -  "`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` Prefix Not Working" - Solution Step 1:**

*   **Issue:** "Correctly pasted" is vague.
*   **Suggestion:** Reiterate need to copy *content* of *all* files and paste into *correct* settings areas, perhaps with a checklist.

**11. "Revised Guidance on 'Update Memory Bank' Command" Section:**

*   **Issue:** Initial sentence might downplay the importance of `update memory bank`.
*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to emphasize `update memory bank` as a *highly recommended best practice* for session management.

**Overall Tone and Style:**

*   **Issue:** Tone is sometimes dry and technical.
*   **Suggestion:** Inject a more encouraging and user-friendly tone throughout the guide.

## Next Steps

1.  Present this analysis and improvement plan to the user.
2.  Upon user approval, proceed with revising `user-guide.md` based on these suggestions.
