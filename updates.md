# Progress Log

## 2025-02-09: Intelligent Mode Switching Implementation

### Completed (2025-02-09 22:19)
1. **Enhanced Mode Switching System**
   - Implemented comprehensive intent-based triggers
   - Added bi-directional switching between all modes
   - Integrated context preservation mechanism
   - Updated all .clinerules files with new configuration

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Enhanced developer-primer.md with new mode switching details
   - Updated mode-switching-spec.md with latest capabilities

   - Improved configuration examples and trigger documentation

3. **Memory Bank Updates**
   - Updated activeContext.md with current progress
   - Added new decision log entry in decisionLog.md
   - Enhanced progress tracking in this file
   - Maintained comprehensive cross-referencing

### Latest Features
1. **Intent-Based Triggers**
   - Code mode: implement, create, build, debug, test
   - Architect mode: design, structure, plan, organize
   - Ask mode: explain, help, what, how, why

2. **Operational Improvements**
   - Context preservation across mode switches
   - File-based and mode-specific triggers
   - Capability-based mode transitions
   - Simplified configuration structure

### Next Steps
1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test intent-based trigger effectiveness
   - Validate context preservation
   - Monitor mode transition accuracy
   - Measure workflow efficiency

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Consider adding more specialized triggers
   - Explore machine learning for trigger refinement
   - Implement transition analytics
   - Gather user feedback

### Known Issues
- Need to validate trigger comprehensiveness
- Performance impact of context preservation to be measured


This document tracks the progress of the Roo Code Memory Bank project.

## Work Done

### February 9, 2025 - Memory Bank File Handling Improvements
- Revised Memory Bank file handling approach:
  - Defined four core Memory Bank files
  - Removed specific filename searches from .clinerules
  - Implemented more flexible Memory Bank detection
  - Moved projectBrief.md to project root
  - Added user prompts for creating missing core files
- Updated documentation to reflect new Memory Bank structure
- Improved support for existing projects with different file organizations

### February 9, 2025 - Enhanced Roo Mode Behaviors
- Created comprehensive mode configuration files (.clinerules-*) for all three modes
- Added explicit instructions for Memory Bank initialization and usage
- Implemented consistent behavior across modes:
  - Immediate reading of all Memory Bank files on activation
  - Restricted use of attempt_completion directive
  - Added task presentation based on Memory Bank content
  - Improved user interaction flow
- Added detailed UMB (Update Memory Bank) procedures for each mode

### Previous Work
- Created and populated initial Memory Bank structure
- Implemented basic Memory Bank detection and initialization
- Developed initial mode-specific rules and responsibilities
- Created documentation framework
- Resolved various tool-related issues and bugs

### Completed in Current Session (2025-02-09)

#### Mode Definition Improvements
- Completely revised role definitions for all three modes:
  - Architect: Strategic leader for system design and documentation
  - Code: Implementation-focused developer
  - Ask: Knowledge assistant and documentation analyzer
- Added explicit responsibilities and collaboration patterns
- Clarified file authority for each mode

#### Memory Bank System Enhancements
- Standardized Memory Bank detection process across all modes
- Added explicit tool calling syntax in rules
- Implemented clear mode-specific responses to Memory Bank states
- Improved status prefix handling (`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE/INACTIVE]`)

#### Rule File Updates
- Updated all `.clinerules-xxx` files with improved structure
- Added standardized Memory Bank detection procedures
- Clarified mode collaboration patterns
- Enhanced UMB process documentation

## Current Status

Mode definitions and Memory Bank management rules have been significantly improved. The system is ready for testing with the new rules to verify improved reliability and clarity in mode interactions. Next step is to test the revised system with Roo to validate the changes.
