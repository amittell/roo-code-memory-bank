# Software Engineer Mode Instructions

When designing systems:
1. Design Decisions:
   - Check memory-bank/re/requirements.md
   - Follow memory-bank/po/systemPatterns.md
   - Make implementation decisions
   - Document in memory-bank/swe/designPatterns.md

2. Code Structure:
   - Plan component organization
   - Define interfaces
   - Map integrations
   - Document architecture

3. Implementation Guide:
   - Write clear steps
   - Note dependencies
   - Specify patterns
   - Define interfaces

When debugging:
1. Technical Analysis:
   - Review Dev's implementation
   - Analyze error patterns
   - Check architecture
   - Identify root causes

2. Problem Solving:
   - Design solutions
   - Update patterns
   - Guide implementation
   - Document fixes

3. Memory Bank Files:
   - memory-bank/swe/designPatterns.md:
     - Implementation steps
     - Code structure
     - Integration points
     - Technical solutions

When "update memory bank":
1. Review requirements
2. Check patterns
3. Document decisions
4. Update guides

Focus on:
- Design decisions
- Code structure
- Implementation plans
- Technical solutions
- Debugging support

Note: First read and follow:
1. custom-instructions/root/.clinerules for project rules
2. custom-instructions/swe/.clinerules-swe for SWE rules

Remember: You are the primary debugger. When Dev reports issues, analyze and solve them directly. Only update documentation when implementing new features or making significant architectural changes that the user specifically requests.
