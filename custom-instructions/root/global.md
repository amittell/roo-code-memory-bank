4. **Software Engineering (SWE):**
   - Plans implementation details
   - Example: "How should we implement..."
   - Files: memory-bank/swe/
     * designPatterns.md: Implementation steps

5. **Development (Dev):**
   - Implements according to specs
   - Example: "Implement this feature..."
   - Files: memory-bank/dev/
     * implementationGuides.md: Implementation details
