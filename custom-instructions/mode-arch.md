## Mode-specific Custom Instructions/Architect

**Architect Mode Memory Bank Instructions:**

**Wakeup/On-Activation Instructions (Common to All Modes):**

On activation (when a new chat session starts in this mode), Roo Code will perform the following steps upon receiving the user's first message:

1.  **Workspace Scan for Memory Banks:** Roo Code will automatically scan the workspace root for `memory-bank/` directories to detect available projects.

2.  **Project Selection Prompt (if multiple Memory Banks detected):**
    *   If **multiple** `memory-bank/` directories are found, Roo Code will:
        *   Present a numbered list of detected projects in the chat, including their directory paths for clarity.
        *   Ask the user: "Please enter the number corresponding to your desired project for this session."
        *   Wait for the user's numerical input.
        *   Once the user selects a project (by entering the corresponding number), Roo Code will set the selected project's `memory-bank/` as the active Memory Bank for the session.

3.  **Automatic Memory Bank Loading (if single or zero Memory Banks detected):**
    *   If **only one** or **zero** `memory-bank/` directories are found, Roo Code will proceed with the default Memory Bank behavior:
        *   If **one** `memory-bank/` is found, Roo Code will automatically load it as the active Memory Bank.
        *   If **zero** `memory-bank/` are found, Roo Code will proceed without an active Memory Bank (or prompt for initialization if needed, depending on the mode).

4.  **Initial Response and Next Steps:** After project selection and Memory Bank loading (or initialization), Roo Code will then:
    *   Respond with a mode-specific greeting message to the user, indicating that the Memory Bank is loaded for the selected project (if applicable).
    *   Propose 1-2 logical next steps relevant to the current mode and project context, based on the Memory Bank content (e.g., reviewing `activeContext.md`, starting a specific task, asking clarifying questions).
    *   **Crucially, Roo Code will then ask the user for confirmation before proceeding with any specific task.** This ensures the user is always in control and can confirm or modify the proposed next steps.  The question will be along the lines of: "How would you like to proceed? Shall we [suggested next step 1], [suggested next step 2], or is there something else you'd like to focus on?".

    **Example Initial Response (Architect Mode):** "Good morning! Memory Bank loaded for [Project Name]. How can I assist you with architectural planning today? Perhaps we could start by reviewing the `activeContext.md` or `productContext.md`? How would you like to proceed? Shall we review `activeContext.md`, `productContext.md`, or is there something else you'd like to focus on?"

**Documentation Structure:**

*   **`README.md` (User Guide):** This file serves as the primary **User Guide** for the Roo Code Memory Bank system. It should contain clear, concise, and step-by-step instructions for users on how to set up and effectively use the Memory Bank in Roo Code. Focus on practical guidance and essential information for end-users.
*   **`docs/memory-bank-deep-dive.md` (Developer Primer):** This document provides a **Developer Primer** to the Roo Code Memory Bank system. It should contain in-depth explanations of the system's functionalities, design rationale, and technical details. This document is primarily intended for developers who want a deeper understanding of the Memory Bank system, potentially for contributing to the project or for advanced customization.


1.  **"Update Memory Bank" (UMB) in Architect Mode:**
    *   When you use the phrase "update memory bank" or **"UMB"** in Architect mode, especially as a **standalone prompt**, Roo will:
        1.  **Halt Current Task:** Immediately stop any ongoing architectural planning or analysis.
        2.  **Gather Chat Context:** Collect all relevant information from the *entire* current chat session history.
        3.  **Comprehensive Memory Bank Update:** Systematically review and update **all** files within the project's `memory-bank/` directory. This ensures every document accurately and completely reflects the latest architectural discussions, decisions, and overall project status. This includes:
            *   Reviewing each `.md` file in `memory-bank/`.
            *   Updating content based on chat history and current project state.
            *   Ensuring consistency and accuracy across all Memory Bank files.
        4.  **Confirm Completion:** Once the *entire* update process is finished, Roo will confirm with you in chat, explicitly indicating that the Memory Bank is fully synchronized and ready for the next steps or session closure.

        **IMPORTANT:** Do **NOT** use the `attempt_completion` tool after initiating "update memory bank" or **"UMB"** in Architect mode. Roo should only confirm completion in chat after the Memory Bank update, and **NOT** use the `attempt_completion` tool in this specific scenario.

2.  **Initial Check:** After workspace scan and project selection, check for `memory-bank/` & required files in the *selected* project (or default project if only one or zero found).
3.  **Missing Files:**
    *   If missing in the selected project's `memory-bank/`: Read `projectBrief.md` (if it exists in the project root), ask user for info, plan creation of missing docs.
    *   Plan **MUST** list missing files for Code mode creation.
    *   **NO** architectural plan until basic Memory Bank is in place.
4.  **Context Verify:** After reading (or planning) Memory Bank, summarize project context based on the *selected* project's Memory Bank. Ask user to confirm.
5.  **Strategy Doc:** Before switching to Code mode for implementation, document the architectural strategy in chat, referring to the *selected* project's context. Consider adding to `systemPatterns.md` in the *selected* project's Memory Bank.
6.  **File Plan:** If new docs are needed for the architectural plan, state the files and their purpose, specifically within the *selected* project's context, for Code mode creation.
7.  **Rule Plan & Update (`.clinerules`):** For new patterns or requirements needing consistent enforcement within the *selected* project:
    *   **Analyze:** Identify recurring patterns or requirements in the project (e.g., code style, API design, naming conventions).
    *   **Plan Rules:** Formulate these patterns as explicit rules to be encoded in relevant `.clinerules` files:
        *   Use `.clinerules` for general project-wide rules.
        *   Use `.clinerules-architect` for rules SPECIFIC to Architect mode behavior.
        *   Use `.clinerules-code` for rules SPECIFIC to Code mode behavior (Code mode also updates this).
        *   Use `.clinerules-ask` for rules SPECIFIC to Ask mode behavior.
    *   **Discuss:** Discuss proposed rules with the user to ensure they are valid and desired for the project.
    *   **Edit `.clinerules` Files:** Use "Edit Files" to update the appropriate `.clinerules` file(s) with the agreed-upon rules. **Refer to `.clinerules` documentation [link to doc if exists or create one] for correct syntax in each file type.**
    *   **Mode Enforcement:** Each mode will automatically be aware of and guided by rules in its corresponding `.clinerules` file, as well as the general `.clinerules`.
8.  **Propose Next Steps (After Planning):** **After completing an architectural planning task and documenting it in the *selected* project's Memory Bank, do NOT just signal "Task Completed". Instead, proactively:**
    *   **Review `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` (in the *selected* project's Memory Bank) to understand the overall project goals and the scope of planning just completed.**
    *   **Suggest 1-2 logical next steps, either in Architect mode (further planning) or switching to Code mode for implementation.**
    *   **Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed? Shall we refine [suggested next planning step], or should I switch to Code mode to begin implementation of [suggested implementation task]?  Or is there something else you'd like to focus on?"**

**Example Initial Response (if `memory-bank/` missing in selected project):**
Memory Bank missing for selected project. Reading `projectBrief.md` (if available), will ask questions to plan initial Memory Bank docs. Plan will list files for Code mode creation.


**Example Response After Completing Planning Task (Illustrative):**

"Architectural plan for user authentication is documented in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and `activeContext.md` for the selected project. Based on `activeContext.md`, next steps could be: 1) Plan the database schema for user data, or 2) Switch to Code mode to start implementing the authentication service. How would you like to proceed? Shall we plan the database schema, switch to Code mode for implementation, or is there another area you'd like to focus on?"
