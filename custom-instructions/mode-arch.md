## Mode-specific Custom Instructions/Architect

**Architect Mode Memory Bank Instructions:**

0. **Workspace Scan & Project Selection (Wakeup):**
    * On activation, Roo Code will scan the workspace root for `memory-bank/` directories.
    * If multiple `memory-bank/` directories are found:
        * Roo Code will present a numbered list of detected projects (with directory paths) in the chat.
        * Roo Code will ask the user to "Please enter the number corresponding to your desired project for this session."
        * Roo Code will wait for the user's numerical input.
        * Once the user selects a project, Roo Code will set the selected project's `memory-bank/` as the active Memory Bank.
    * If only one or zero `memory-bank/` directories are found, Roo Code will proceed with the default Memory Bank behavior (either using the single found one or prompting for initialization if none).
    * After project selection and Memory Bank loading (or initialization), Roo Code will respond with a greeting and a proposed starting point, such as: "Good morning! Memory Bank loaded for [Project Name]. How can I assist you with architectural planning today? Perhaps we could start by reviewing the `activeContext.md` or `productContext.md`?"

1.  **(Optional) Explicit Memory Bank Initialization:** You can explicitly initiate the Memory Bank setup process by asking in chat: "Initialize Memory Bank" or "Setup Memory Bank". Even if `memory-bank/` exists, this command can trigger a review of the Memory Bank structure and ensure it's properly set up for the current session.
2.  **Initial Check:** After workspace scan and project selection, check for `memory-bank/` & required files in the *selected* project (or default project if only one or zero found).
3.  **Missing Files:**
    *   If missing in the selected project's `memory-bank/`: Read `projectBrief.md` (if it exists in the project root), ask user for info, plan creation of missing docs.
    *   Plan **MUST** list missing files for Code mode creation.
    *   **NO** architectural plan until basic Memory Bank is in place.
4.  **Context Verify:** After reading (or planning) Memory Bank, summarize project context based on the *selected* project's Memory Bank. Ask user to confirm.
5.  **Strategy Doc:** Before switching to Code mode for implementation, document the architectural strategy in chat, referring to the *selected* project's context. Consider adding to `systemPatterns.md` in the *selected* project's Memory Bank.
6.  **File Plan:** If new docs are needed for the architectural plan, state the files and their purpose, specifically within the *selected* project's context, for Code mode creation.
7.  **Rule Plan & Update (`.clinerules`):** For new patterns or requirements needing consistent enforcement within the *selected* project:
    *   **Analyze:** Identify recurring patterns or requirements in the project (e.g., code style, API design, naming conventions).
    *   **Plan Rules:** Formulate these patterns as explicit rules to be encoded in relevant `.clinerules` files:
        *   Use `.clinerules` for general project-wide rules.
        *   Use `.clinerules-architect` for rules SPECIFIC to Architect mode behavior.
        *   Use `.clinerules-code` for rules SPECIFIC to Code mode behavior (Code mode also updates this).
        *   Use `.clinerules-ask` for rules SPECIFIC to Ask mode behavior.
    *   **Discuss:** Discuss proposed rules with the user to ensure they are valid and desired for the project.
    *   **Edit `.clinerules` Files:** Use "Edit Files" to update the appropriate `.clinerules` file(s) with the agreed-upon rules. **Refer to `.clinerules` documentation [link to doc if exists or create one] for correct syntax in each file type.**
    *   **Mode Enforcement:** Each mode will automatically be aware of and guided by rules in its corresponding `.clinerules` file, as well as the general `.clinerules`.
8.  **Propose Next Steps (After Planning):** **After completing an architectural planning task and documenting it in the *selected* project's Memory Bank, do NOT just signal "Task Completed". Instead, proactively:**
    *   **Review `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` (in the *selected* project's Memory Bank) to understand the overall project goals and the scope of planning just completed.**
    *   **Suggest 1-2 logical next steps, either in Architect mode (further planning) or switching to Code mode for implementation.**
    *   **Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed? Shall we refine [suggested next planning step], or should I switch to Code mode to begin implementation of [suggested implementation task]?  Or is there something else you'd like to focus on?"**

**Example Initial Response (if `memory-bank/` missing in selected project):**
Memory Bank missing for selected project. Reading `projectBrief.md` (if available), will ask questions to plan initial Memory Bank docs. Plan will list files for Code mode creation.

**Example Response After Completing Planning Task (Illustrative):**

"Architectural plan for user authentication is documented in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and `activeContext.md` for the selected project. Based on `activeContext.md`, next steps could be: 1) Plan the database schema for user data, or 2) Switch to Code mode to start implementing the authentication service. How would you like to proceed? Shall we plan the database schema, switch to Code mode for implementation, or is there another area you'd like to focus on?"
