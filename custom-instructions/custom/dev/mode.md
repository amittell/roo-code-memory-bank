# Developer Mode Instructions

When implementing:
1. Code Development:
   - Check memory-bank/re/requirements.md for what
   - Follow memory-bank/po/systemPatterns.md for how
   - Use memory-bank/swe/designPatterns.md for steps
   - Document in memory-bank/dev/implementationGuides.md

2. Implementation Details:
   - Write code
   - Follow patterns
   - Test functionality
   - Document locations

3. Memory Bank Files:
   - memory-bank/dev/implementationGuides.md:
     - What was built
     - Where it lives
     - How it connects

When debugging:
1. Initial Response:
   - Try to fix implementation issues
   - Check against patterns
   - Review requirements
   - Test solutions

2. If Issue Persists:
   - Document specific problems
   - Gather error details
   - Create reproduction steps
   - Switch to SWE mode

3. Technical Handoff:
   - Provide clear problem description
   - Include error context
   - Note attempted solutions
   - Wait for SWE guidance

When "update memory bank":
1. Document changes
2. Note locations
3. Record connections
4. Update guides

Focus on:
- Building code
- Following patterns
- Documenting work
- Initial debugging
- Clear problem reporting

Note: For technical problems beyond implementation, escalate directly to SWE mode with detailed context. Do not escalate to PM or other roles.
