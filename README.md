A requirements-driven development system that maintains project context and coordinates multiple specialized roles through a shared Memory Bank.

## Overview

The Memory Bank system provides persistent memory across chat sessions through a hierarchical role structure:

```
Requirements Engineer (RE)
         ‚Üì
    Project Owner (PO)
         ‚Üì
    Task Manager (TM)
         ‚Üì
Software Engineer (SWE)
         ‚Üì
    Developer (Dev)
```

## Roles and Responsibilities

   - Notes connections

## How to Implement

### For a New Project

1. Initial Setup:
```
Select RE mode: "Switch to RE mode"
Then: "I want to create a new [type] application that [purpose]"
```
The RE will:
- Gather requirements through questions
- Analyze any referenced projects
- Guide technology choices
- Create initial Memory Bank structure

2. Development Process:
```
RE: Define requirements and analyze dependencies
 ‚Üì
PO: Approve patterns and structure
 ‚Üì
TM: Track task status
 ‚Üì
SWE: Plan implementation details
 ‚Üì
Dev: Implement features
```

3. Maintaining Focus:
- Use "update memory bank" regularly
- Let RE validate all changes
- Follow role hierarchy
- Keep documentation current

### For an Existing Project

1. Initial Analysis:
```
Select RE mode: "Switch to RE mode"
Then: "Analyze the existing project at [path]. The project uses [package-file-type] for dependencies."
```
Example:
```
"Analyze the existing project at c:/git/Roo. The project uses package.json for dependencies."
```

The RE will:
- Analyze current codebase
- Review package manifest
- Document requirements
- Create Memory Bank structure

2. Integration Process:
```
RE: Document current state and requirements
 ‚Üì
PO: Review and document patterns
 ‚Üì
TM: Track task status
 ‚Üì
SWE: Plan implementation details
 ‚Üì
Dev: Implement features
```

3. Moving Forward:
- Follow role hierarchy
- Update Memory Bank with changes
- Maintain documentation
- Use roles appropriately

## Best Practices

1. Requirements First:
   - Always start with RE
   - Get explicit approval
   - Document verified facts

2. Follow Hierarchy:
   - Respect role order
   - Wait for approvals
   - Maintain coordination

3. Keep Documentation Current:
   - Update regularly
   - Document changes
   - Stay focused

4. Use Appropriate Role:
   - Match task to role
   - Switch when needed
   - Stay on track

5. Prevent Scope Creep:
   - Check with RE
   - Get approvals
   - Document only facts

## FAQ

### When should I use each mode?

#### Requirements Engineer (RE) Mode
Use for new features or project scope:
```
"I want to add a dark mode feature"
"What dependencies does this project need?"
"Can we support mobile devices?"
```
RE documents in memory-bank/re/requirements.md and gets user confirmation.

#### Project Owner (PO) Mode
Use for pattern and architecture decisions:
```
"Is this the right pattern for dark mode?"
"Should we use CSS variables or classes?"
"How should we structure the theme system?"
```
PO documents approved patterns in memory-bank/po/systemPatterns.md.

#### Task Manager (TM) Mode
Use for tracking task status:
```
"What tasks are done?"
"What's being worked on?"
"What tasks are pending?"
```
TM records facts in memory-bank/tm/taskStatus.md.

#### Software Engineer (SWE) Mode
Use for implementation planning:
```
"How should we implement the theme switcher?"
"What's the best way to integrate this?"
"How should components interact?"
```
SWE documents steps in memory-bank/swe/designPatterns.md.

#### Developer (Dev) Mode
Use for implementation and debugging:
```
"The theme switcher is broken in Firefox"
"Add the dark mode toggle button"
"Fix the CSS variable inheritance"
```
Dev documents details in memory-bank/dev/implementationGuides.md.

### Which mode for debugging?
Use Dev mode because:
- Has command access for testing
- Can use browser_action to verify
- Can modify implementation
- Documents actual implementation details in memory-bank/dev/implementationGuides.md

### Which mode for new features?
Start in RE mode because:
- Documents verified requirements in memory-bank/re/requirements.md
- Gets explicit user confirmation
- Maintains project scope
- Prevents feature creep

The process then flows:
RE ‚Üí PO ‚Üí SWE ‚Üí Dev
1. RE verifies requirements
2. PO approves patterns
3. SWE plans implementation
4. Dev builds it

### Which mode for persistent bugs?
When a bug persists despite Dev and SWE attempts:
```
Initial Debug Flow:
Dev ‚Üí Implementation fixes
  ‚Üì
SWE ‚Üí Technical solutions
  ‚Üì
If still failing and suspect design issues ‚Üí PO
```

Go to PO mode because:
- PO owns systemPatterns.md
- PO approves implementation patterns
- PO makes architectural decisions
- PO can authorize pattern changes

After PO review:
1. If pattern change approved:
   - SWE designs new approach
   - Dev implements solution
2. If pattern stays:
   - SWE must solve within constraints
   - Dev implements fix

This ensures architectural decisions get proper review before any major changes.
